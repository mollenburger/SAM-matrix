### GCAM - SAM ###
  Evaluating agricultural sustainability with the Global Change Analysis Model and the Sustainable Agriculture Matrix

[The Sustainable Agriculture Matrix (SAM)](https://research.al.umces.edu/sam/) was first proposed by M.S. Swaminathan for agricultural research and policy in 1990 (see Swaminathan, 2010), and this project is among the first of its kind to develop the illustrative components into measurable indicators. Recognizing the knowledge gap between complex/controversial definitions of Sustainable Agriculture and limited data, as well as the demand for a timely product, we have selected a group of indicators to this first edition of SAM and we outline the roadmap for updating SAM annually (or bi-annually) thereafter according to the results of continuing efforts by the SAM project team.

[The Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM)](http://www.globalchange.umd.edu/gcam/) is an integrated tool for exploring the dynamics of the coupled human-Earth system and the response of this system to global changes. GCAM is a global model that represents the behavior of, and interactions between five systems: the energy system, water, agriculture and land use, the economy, and the climate.

This project calculates indicators for the SAM based on GCAM outputs in order to evaluate sustainability in multiple future scenarios.


Currently evaluating 3 scenarios:
- Yield gaps closed to 75% of potential yield by 2050 (scenario "PotYld")
- Dietary transition (based on [EAT-LANCET FLX scenario](https://eatforum.org/eat-lancet-commission/)) (scenario "DietaryTransition")
- Both Yield gap closure and dietary transition (scenario "PotYld_Diet")

Results can be viewed via a work-in-progress shiny app [here](https://mollenburger.shinyapps.io/SAM-matrix/)
